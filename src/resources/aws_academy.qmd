This is a guide that shows you how to:

  1) Access the AWS academy and start the lab you'll be working on.
  2) How to automatically create the resources that we give to you for PRAC-4.3 and PRAC-4.4 (VPC's, subnets, etc.)
  3) \[Optional\]: How to stop the lab in case you don't want to run your resources 24/7
  4) \[Optional\]: How to reset the lab, so you can "start fresh" if something is wrong or you want to re-try the assignment from a "clean" aws environment.

# Login to AWS Academy and access the course

# \[Optional: only on first time or lab Reset\] Create the networks of our Lab

The first time you run the lab (or after resetting it), you'll need to execute the command we provided. This will automatically create the resources required for PRAC-4.3 and PRAC-4.4, so you don’t have to create them manually.

Simply copy the command and paste it into the terminal.

Make sure the lab is running (the indicator in the top-left corner should show `AWS 🟢`, not `AWS 🔴`):

::: {.callout-important title="**Wait! 🚨**"}
**Wait for the command to finish, or the resources won't be created successfully!**
:::

# Access AWS UI
Click on the `AWS 🟢` on the top left corner:

You're now on a "normal" AWS Services UI:

# End the Lab

::: {.callout-important title="**Why you should end the lab! 🚨**"}
Ending an AWS lab ensures that all the resources created during the session are properly shut down.

If you don’t end the lab, those resources may continue running and consume your limited AWS budget. While you can leave the lab without ending it, a misconfigured or resource-intensive service could use up your 50$ credit unexpectedly.

This may prevent you from completing future assignments, so it’s important to end each lab to avoid unnecessary costs.

Click on the `end lab` button:

Accept it:

# Reset the Lab

::: {.callout-important title="**Why you would want to reset the lab! 🚨**"}
You might want to reset an AWS lab to return the environment to its original, clean state when things go wrong or become confusing.

If a service is misconfigured, settings are changed in the wrong way, or the environment no longer matches the lab instructions, resetting is often faster and easier than trying to fix everything manually. 

TLDR; Resetting lets you start fresh.

Click on the `reset` button:
