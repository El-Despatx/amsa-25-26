This is a guide that shows you how to how to setup the aws-cli to get your credentials of the current lab.

# Install the AWS-CLI.

This depends on your linux distribution (or, if you’re on Windows, your questionable operating system), for ubuntu you can use [the following tutorial](https://scribe.rip/install-aws-cli-version-2-on-ubuntu-windows-and-mac-545e19814496).

**Be sure to install AWS CLI v2 (not v1).**
The versions are not fully compatible, and many commands work differently.

# Configure the AWS-Cli with your credentials

Click the `AWS Details` button on the lab:

Then, click on the `AWS CLI: Show` button:

Now, do the steps that the ui tell's you, this mean:

1) **On your machine**, create the file:  `/home/{your_user}/.aws/credentials`.
2) Paste the credentials provided on the AWS page into that file.

# Assert that you're authenticated

Run the following command to verify that you’re authenticated:

```bash
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see output similar to:

```json
{
    "UserId": "AROAVRUVSF2DSXYQRBTVG:user4610787=Pablo_Fraile",
    "Account": "381492014727",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::381492014727:assumed-role/voclabs/user4610787=Pablo_Fraile"
}
```

Make sure the result shows your name.
