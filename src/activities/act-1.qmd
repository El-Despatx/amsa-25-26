subtitle: "Activity 1: Booting & systemd"
format: html

## Activity brief

Develop a systemd service that outputs "Hello, <your name> in ASCII art every time you boot up your virtual machine"

For this you must:

1. Create a script that prints the message
2. Create a `systemd` service linked to this script 
3. Move the service and start it properly

Do it with any language you prefer, although bash is probably the simpliest one.

## What to send?

To complete this activity, you must deliver **a link to your Github repository**, which in one folder will contain:

-   The script itself
-   The `.service` file
-   A screenshot of your `journalctl` output, where the script output can be seen.
