## 1. Introduction
The objective for this assignment is to __dockerize and orchestrate a provided API.__


We've created an [API](https://www.postman.com/what-is-an-api/#how-do-apis-work), a system that helps communicate between different applications by defining clear rules for how data is requested, sent, and received.

There are lots of different behaviours for APIs, but they will typically have:

- Endpoint: An API endpoint is a dedicated URL that provides access to a specific resource. For instance, the /articles endpoint in a blogging app would include the logic for processing all requests that are related to articles.
- Method: The request's method indicates the type of operation the client would like to perform on a given resource. REST APIs are accessible through standard HTTP methods, which perform common actions like retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data.
- Parameters: Parameters are the variables that are passed to an API endpoint to provide specific instructions for the API to process. These parameters can be included in the API request as part of the URL, in the query string, or in the request body. For example, the /articles endpoint of a blogging API might accept a “topic” parameter, which it would use to access and return articles on a specific topic.
- Request body: The body is the main part of the request, and it includes the actual data that is required to create, update, or delete a resource. For instance, if you were creating a new article in a blogging app, the request body would likely include the article's content, title, and author.

The objective of this activity is to dockerize and deploy to AWS our API, while also learning about databases in the way.

## 2. Delivery

*Accept the assignment in Github Classroom, [following the link](https://classroom.github.com/a/HU7ENUMi)*

To complete this activity, you must do the following for each sub-delivery (PRAC-4.1, PRAC-4.2, PRAC-4.3 and PRAC-4.4):

1.  Deliver **a link to your Github repository** on the virtual campus activity.

2.  Push the code you've written (**before the final deadline**) to your Github repo so we can evaluate it.

::: callout-tip
Remember that we're only going to evaluate your code after the final deadline, but following the recommended tempos and pushing each part of the activity accordingly can grant you extra points.

## 3. Outline
This activity is split onto 4 incremental parts, which are going to be related to the contents explained during the different classes.

1.  On the first week, once we have explained **virtualization, containers and OCI images**, your job will be to dockerize the API.
2.  On the second week, once we have explained **compose and databases**, your job will be to communicate the API with a database through compose.
3.  Then, after having explained the **AWS environment, apprunners**, we'll want you to deploy the work we've done to AWS and communicate it through different services.

## 4. Resources

Building this all for yourself is out of scope for this subject. For that reason, the teachers have prepared some resources that will hopefully make the activity shorter and more enjoyable.

### `User` API

The python API for the users has been already implemented for you. You will have it available on your repository template.

### Repository template

When you join the Github Classroom activity with the link provided on Step 2, a remote repository is automatically created for you to work on this assignment. This repository will already contain some code, below are the details of what comes with the repo:

1.  It already has the API implemented on the root folder. It has everything needed serve the API, which you can do by running `uv run fastapi run` after syncing your dependencies (more info on the README).

2.  A `README.md` file where you'll have instructions on how to set up the python environment.

### The API
How does our API work?

While the API is running, by accessing `http://localhost:8000/docs` you will be able to:
    - Create a user given:
        - A username
        - A name
        - A role ("user" or "admin")
        - A password
    - List all existing users

Once the request to create a new user is sent, the password is then hashed and the user is given an "automatic" ID.
Then, the user is stored on the database.

### The database
Our app has different ways of "picking" the database:

- By default, it uses an internal [sqlite](https://sqlite.org/index.html), which just uses a file as the database. This is common for development.
- If the `PROD` environment variable is set, then it will attempt to connect to a [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org) database, TODO klk postgres.
However, we need more data to connect to this database:

    - `DB_USER`: The user who will connect to the database
    - `DB_PASSWORD`: The password to connect to the database
    - `DB_HOST`: The IP address of the host of the database
    - `DB_PORT`: The port of the host of the database
    - `DB_NAME`: The name of the database inside postgresql

## 5. Tasks
### Prac-4.1: Dockerizing the API
Your objective is to **dockerize the API**

That's it, we keep it simple this week.
Write a `Dockerfile` to deploy the API inside a container.

Keep in mind that the command you must run inside the Docker container is *uv run fastapi run*, and that **dependencies have to be synced** before.

Your goal should be to make the resulting image as **small as possible**, as that's what good developers should do!

### Prac-4.2: Moving to Docker Compose 
Your objective is to **switch the API's db to a postgresql, and communicate it through Docker compose** 
Woah woah woah! That looks like a lot! Let's go step by step

1. Move the dockerized image onto a compose service. This should be a straight-forward step
2. Deploy a postgresql database on the compose. Don't stress on joining them yet!
3. Now it's time to communicate them. **TIP: We've already told you cannot modify python code. There's probably some way around it...**

The resulting file should be a `docker-compose.yml` with both services and their respective configuration.

### Prac-4.3: TODO!
This section is still under construction 🚧⛏️️👷️

### Prac-4.4: TODO!
This section is still under construction 🚧⛏️️👷️

## 6. Setting the environment up!
### Cloning the repository and set it up:

Remember that, once you entered the Github Classroom on [section 2](act-4.qmd#delivery), you will have to clone your repository with [^2]:

[^2]: If you don't have any idea of what we're talking about, revisit the [setting up the VM and brief git summary](/resources/vm_git.qmd)

``` bash
git clone <ssh_address_of_your_git_repository>
```

Then, enter inside the folder of the repository, on the `user-api` fodler, setup a virtual environment for the python project, which can be done with:

``` bash
uv sync
```

## 7. Evaluation

Your final score will come from various parts:

-   4.1 → 15%.
-   4.2 → 15%.
-   4.3 → 15%.
-   4.4 → 15%.
-   Best practices are used → 40%.
    - How small is your Docker image?
    - Is your compose deterministic? 
    - Does your compose expose more than needed?
    - ...

## 8. Rules

1.  It is **forbidden to modify our python code (the given API)**. It has everything you need and there's no need to modify it. If you feel like modifying the code would make something better, **contact the teachers before doing so**.
2.  In the `Dockerfile` for the user API, the dependencies must be installed in the Docker, not in runtime
3.  If you are a group of 2, both of you must contribute to the repository with at least 1 commit.

## 10. Doubts

Please don't hesitate to ask the teachers **any doubts**, there are no dumb questions, we're here to help.

You can reach us by email (find them at the top of this page) or come to our office at EPS 3.07 (we're here mostly during mornings).
