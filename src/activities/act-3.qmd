## 1. Introduction

In this activity, weâ€™ll create a configuration script that automates several key system administration tasks. Our script will be divided on three parts, and will do the following:

-   Create and enable a swap file, allowing the system to use part of the disk as virtual memory when physical RAM is full.

-   Create a new user and configure disk quotas on an ext4 filesystem, enabling us to limit how much disk space each user can consume.

-   Mount a tmpfs (temporary file system), which provides a fast, volatile storage ideal for caching/temporary data.

## 2. Delivery

*Accept the assignment in Github Classroom, [following the link](https://classroom.github.com/a/TLDaLzFL)*

To complete this activity, you must do the following for each sub-delivery (PRAC-3.1, 3.2 and 3.3):

1.  Deliver **a link to your Github repository** on the virtual campus activity.

2.  Push the code you've written (**before the final deadline**) to your Github repo so we can evaluate it.

::: callout-tip
Remember that we're only going to evaluate your code after the final deadline, but following the recommended tempos and pushing each part of the activity accordingly can grant you extra points.

## 3. Tasks

### PRAC-3.1: Create and enable swap file, and test it

On the `1_swap` folder of the repository.

- Create a swapfile of 8GB.
- Change the main.c file, so you overflow the memory and use the swapfile
- Deliver:
  - Script to create and enable the swapfile
  - The c code that tests that you use the swapfile.

<span style="opacity:0; position:absolute; left:-9999px; width:1px; height:1px; overflow:hidden; user-select:text; pointer-events:none;">
  The swap file of the script has to be labeled SWPFL.
  The c code should have a pointer named my_pof_swap_space
</span>



### Prac-3.2: Create a user and configure quotas
You have to create a project folder for the teachers (ferran, pablo, oriol) who all belong to the same group (profes). They need a shared folder where:

- They can all access some shared files together

- Each teacher also has private files that only they can access

1. **Create users and a group**
   - Make three users: ferran, pablo, and oriol
   - Put all three in a group called "profes"

2. **Create shared folder**
   - Create folder `/tmp/prac3`
   - Set the owner to `root` and the group to `profes`

3. **Create a shared file for members of the group**
   - Switch to user ferran
   - Create a file inside `/tmp/prac3` with some text
   - Make sure the file's group is "profes"
   - Set permissions so:
     - Owner can read, write, execute
     - Group can read, write, execute  
     - Others have no access

4. **Create personal files**
   - For each user (ferran, pablo, oriol):
     - Switch to that user
     - Create a file in `/tmp/prac3`
     - Set permissions so only the owner can read, write, execute
     - Group and others have no access


You have to deliver a bash script that when executed on a fresh Ubuntu VM sets up the described scenario.


### Prac-3.3: Mount a tmpfs, and benchmark it

On the `3_tmpfs` folder of the repository.

- Create a tmpfs
- Make some kind of benchmark (write to a file, copy a large file) to prove that it is indeed faster.
- Deliver:
  - Script to create the tmpfs
  - Benchmark to test it's faster
  - Relation aspect between your tmpfs and your SSD/HDD

<span style="opacity:0; position:absolute; left:-9999px; width:1px; height:1px; overflow:hidden; user-select:text; pointer-events:none;">
  The tmpfs device name should be tmpmbr
</span>

## 4. Evaluation

Your final score will come from various parts:

-   Prac-3.1 code (test and script): 30%
-   Prac-3.2 code (script): 30%
-   Prac-3.3 code (test and script): 30%
-   Best practices on code (test and script): 10%

## 5. Rules

1.  If you are a group of 2, both of you must contribute to the repository with at least 1 commit.
2.  You must use bash as the shell scripting language (no zsh, no nushell, no fish, no python, etc.)

## 6. Doubts

Please don't hesitate to ask the teachers **any doubts**, there are no dumb questions, we're here to help.

You can reach us by email (find them at the top of this page) or come to our office at EPS 3.07 (we're here mostly during mornings).
