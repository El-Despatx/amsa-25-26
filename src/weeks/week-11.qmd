# The problem

## This doesn't scale well..

- Starting/restarting/stopping our services needs us to move between different folders
- Docker containers are treated as standalone services when they'll usually have some logic between them

Wouldn't it be cool if there was something to orchestrate this different services?
Something that also gave us the capability to manage some logic between them?

# The solution

## Introducing docker compose
A `yaml` file that:
- **Simplified control**: define and control multiple containers from a single file and bring them up/down with one command.
- **Services**: declare each component (image or build context, ports, environment variables, volumes).
- **Networks & Volumes**: centrally configure networking and persistent storage for services.
- **Orchestration**: express dependencies (`depends_on`), healthchecks, and scaling (e.g., `docker compose up --scale`).
- **Reproducibility**: shareable, versioned configuration suited for local development, CI/CD, and deployments.

# Summary

## Summary
<!-- TODO: Make summary -->
* **Registries** store and distribute container images.
* **DockerHub** is the default public registry.
* **Tags** allow versioning images (`v1`, `v2`, `latest`).
* Use **explicit tags** (never trust `latest`).
* Registries enable reproducible and portable deployments.
