# Booting tetris.efi ðŸŽ®
This extra activity demonstrates how you can run the Tetris game without relying on an operating system. Simply write an EFI-compliant program, build it, and execute it directly!

## Reboot to the UEFI VBox firmware:

Open a terminal inside the VM, and execute the following command:

``` {.shell code-line-numbers="true"}
$ sudo systemctl reboot --firmware-setup
```

This uses systemd (init system) to reboot to the firmware of your device, in this case, the firmware is "virtualized" by VirtualBox.

It should appear the following screen:

## Execute the EFI Tetris 

  - We'll go: `Boot Maintenence Manager => Boot from file => Click on the first (and only option)`

  - Load the file that is saved on: `/EFI/BOOT/tetris.efi`

  - Have fun! ðŸ¥³, and play some tetris games!
